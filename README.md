# Data Science Portfolio in Python

This repository contains Data Science projects in Python programming language completed by me for self-learning and demonstration purposes. 

All the projects are done on Jupyter Notebooks (Notebook Server 5.6.0). The server is running on Python version 3.7.0.

I will keep adding more projects as I complete them. The Jupyter Notebook links in all the projects have been provided.

The projects are divided into various categories listed below:-
