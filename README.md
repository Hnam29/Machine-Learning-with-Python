# Data Science Portfolio in Python

This repository contains Data Science projects in Python programming language completed by me for self-learning and demonstration purposes. 

The projects are done on Jupyter Notebooks (Notebook Server 5.5.0). The server is running on Python version 3.6.5.

The projects are divided into various categories listed as follows:- 

## Contents
 
  - ### Machine Learning with Python 
      
      -  ### Supervised Learning : Regression Projects 
   
       - [Simple Linear Regression Project](https://github.com/pb111/Simple-Linear-Regression-Project/blob/master/SLRProject.ipynb): A Simple Linear Regression model to model the linear relationship between Sales and Advertising dataset for a dietary weight control product.   
           
   -  ### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Projects
   
       - [Data Preprocessing Project- Dealing with missing numerical values](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Preprocessing-Project-Dealing-with-Missing-Numerical-Values/blob/master/Data%20Preprocessing%20Project%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Missing%20Numerical%20Values.ipynb) : This project describes various techniques to deal with missing numerical values. 
       
       - [Data Preprocessing Project- Dealing with text and categorical data](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Preprocessing-Project-Dealing-with-Text-and-Categorical-Data-/blob/master/README.md): This project describes various techniques to deal with the text and categorical data.
