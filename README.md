# Data Science Portfolio in Python

This repository contains Data Science projects in Python programming language completed by me for self-learning and demonstration purposes. 

All the projects are done on Jupyter Notebooks (Notebook Server 5.6.0). The server is running on Python version 3.7.0.

I will keep adding more projects as I complete them. The Jupyter Notebook links in all the projects have been provided. The projects description are given in the readme document.

The projects are divided into various categories listed below:-
