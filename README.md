# Data Science Portfolio in Python

This repository contains Data Science projects in Python programming language completed by me for self-learning and demonstration purposes. 

The projects are done on Jupyter Notebooks (Notebook Server 5.6.0). The server is running on Python version 3.7.0.

I will keep adding more projects as I complete them. The Jupyter Notebooks links in all the projects have been provided.

The projects are divided into various categories listed as follows:- 

## Contents
 
  - ### Machine Learning with Python 
      
      -  ### Supervised Learning : Regression Projects 
   
          * [Simple Linear Regression Project](https://github.com/pb111/Simple-Linear-Regression-Project/blob/master/SLRProject.ipynb): A Simple Linear Regression model to model the linear relationship between Sales and Advertising dataset for a dietary weight control product.   
       
          * [Multiple Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/pb111/Multiple-Linear-Regression-Project/blob/master/Multiple%20Linear%20Regression%20using%20Scikit-Learn.ipynb): In this project, I build a Multiple Linear Regression model to estimate the relative CPU performance of computer hardware dataset. I discuss the linear regression assumptions and various tools to estimate the model performance.
