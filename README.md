# Data Science Portfolio in Python

This repository contains Data Science projects in Python programming language completed by me for self-learning and demonstration purposes. 

The projects are done on Jupyter Notebooks (Notebook Server 5.5.0). The server is running on Python version 3.6.5.

The projects are divided into various categories listed as follows:-
